## Results
The graphs presented were divided into the first three by the types of vaccines and the following will be comparative in the doses.
![Pfizer](Images/pfizer.png)
- the italian government started the vaccination campaign with Pfizer in December without major differences in age groups. In February, it prioritized the group from 80 to 89 years old with a clear difference. In the evaluated period and without making a difference between the first and second doses, the total of the pfizer vaccine reached a peak of 120,000 doses in one day.

![Astrazeneca](images/astrazeneca.png)
- The italian government began AstraZeneca campaign with very few doses in January and in February, with greater availability, a prioritization of four groups of people began between 20 and 29 years old, between 30 and 39 years old, between 40 and 49 years old, and finally between 50 and 59 years old, until the middle of March, then it prioritized the group of 70 to 79 years. In the evaluated period and without making a difference between the first and second doses, the total of the AstraZeneca vaccine reached a peak of about 50,000 doses in one day.

![Moderna](images/moderna.png)
- the government began Moderna AstraZeneca in January with few doses, since February they prioritized the group of 80 to 89 years and in the middle of March also prioritize the group of 70 to 79 years. In the evaluated period and without making a difference between the first and second doses, the total of the Modern vaccine reaching a peak of about 14,000 doses in one day, this is the vaccine with the least availability and therefore the least application within the population.

- the government began Moderna AstraZeneca in January with few doses, since February they prioritized the group of 80 to 89 years and in the middle of March also prioritize the group of 70 to 79 years. In the evaluated period and without making a difference between the first and second doses, the total of the Modern vaccine reaching a peak of about 14,000 doses in one day, this is the vaccine with the least availability and therefore the least application within the population.

- In these two graphs you can see the comparison between the two doses of the vaccines, in the case of pfizer the shortage is seen and therefore the decision is made between half of January and the first week of February not to apply more first due to a period in which the second dose is given priority, the case of AstraZeneca shows that it has a period of interruption in the month of March due to the doubts that arose with the vaccine and the application of second doses showing the difference in the times with Regarding the other vaccines, the third is the modern vaccine, this sample that in the second week of March they begin to have greater availability and their application increases both in the first dose and in the second dose at the same time.
